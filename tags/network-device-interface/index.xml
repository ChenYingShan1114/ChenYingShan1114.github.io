      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the time I become an technical art intern in Moonshine Studio which is one of the biggest animation company in Taiwan, I cooperate with many people whose backgrounds are totally very different from me. In the company, the artists made original 2D or 3D animations, motion design, post-production for movies or dramas, such like dynamic simulation, FBX&amp;hellip;, interactive media, and also research and design new technique, such like AI, which is useful in the pipeline of any products. However, I act as intern in a special team which combine realistic and virtualistic to implement virtual production in MoonShine XR studio. They are the first company that introduced virtual production in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
